Below is a list of repositories where you can find code for your mini pupper. Some of these repositories is hosted by MangDang and we make any effort to maintain these repositories. Please open issues on GitHub when you see fit and submit pull requests if you can improve the code.

We are an open community and welcome contributions. If you have written code for mini pupper that you want to share please submit a PR to this repo with the details.

We also provide full stacks that come with a setup script that you can run starting with a SD card with Ubuntu installed. Clone this repository, run the setup script for the stack you want to install and wait until the Raspberry Pi reboots. See below for details.

We highlight the Status of the code as follows:

- **experimental**: this is code in an early stage. Be prepared to debug and discuss if you want to get involved
- **testing**: this code should work but expect to hit some bugs. 
- **working**: the code has been tested and supposed to work as intended. You might still find bugs, please consider to raise a GitHub issue
- **production**: this code is used by many of our users and we encourage you to raise a GitHub issue should you encounter any bug

### Installation

Prepare a SD card with the operating system required for your stack. 

Focal: `ubuntu-20.04.5-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img.xz` is recommended.

https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/20.04/release/

Jammy: `ubuntu-22.04.1-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img.xz` is recommended.

https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/22.04/release/

#### Manual Installation

Boot Mini Pupper with your SD card, configure the network, clone this repository and run the setup script for your stack

#### Fully Automated Installation (experimental)

Clone this repository on the PC where you have created your SD card. Make sure the SD card is mounted. Run

prepare_sd.py

And answer the questions. At the end eject your SD card, stick itto mini pupper, boot minipupper and wait until the IP address is shown on the LCD.
